# Chess with engine
A small project written in a couple of days at the request of friends from another university. I stuffed a bunch of pieces from the terms of reference to get the score as high as possible. 

A bit of shit code, the engine makes random moves, but it's already a few steps ahead to finish counting moves. 

However, for a good depth of calculations of moves, it is worth completely rewriting the implementation of the engine using bitboards (sorry, I didn't have time to figure them out in two evenings), because in this implementation there will be a long count of moves
